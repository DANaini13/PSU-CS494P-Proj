/**
 * Explanation:
 * All the Information in headers are split by "-":
 * For example: ROOM-0 means this packet was package by the room NO.
 * The header contains two message:
 *      1. it has been package by room.
 *      2. the room No is 0.
 * Different header in different level has it's own splitter to the package.
 * For example:
 *      SEND-COMMANDSPL-ROOM-1-ROOMSPL-MESS-MESSAGESPL-0-FunName-Tue Oct 24 15:41:33 PDT 2017-Hello
 *      Above is a packet that sent form the server.
 *      this packet contains three header and three header splitter:
 *      SEND header:   -COMMAND-
 *      ROOM header:   -ROOM-
 *      MESS header:   -MESSAGE-
 *
 *      SEND-COMMANDSPL-ROOM-0-ROOMSPL-MESS-MESSAGESPL-Hello world!
 *      Above is a packet that sent form the client.
 *
 *      which means this packet was packaged by SEND command, Room No. 1 and Message.
 *      The text in the MESS part shows that the user and message information:
 *      userID: 0
 *      userName: funName
 *      sendDate: Tue Oct 24 15:41:33 PDT   // All the date is generated from server.
 *      messageContent: Hello
